# 🛍️ Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

> **"How can a company leverage consumer shopping data to identify trends,
> improve customer engagement, and optimize marketing and product strategies?"**

A complete end-to-end data analytics project analyzing **3,900 retail transactions**
to uncover what drives customer purchases, loyalty, and revenue.

A leading retail company noticed shifts in purchasing patterns across demographics,
product categories, and sales channels. This project digs into that data to answer
10 real business questions — from revenue by gender to customer segmentation and
discount behavior — and delivers actionable recommendations for the business.

## 🔄 Project Workflow
```
Raw Dataset → Python (EDA + Cleaning) → MySQL (SQL Queries) → Power BI Dashboard → Report & PPT
```

### Step 1 — Data Preparation (Python)
- Loaded dataset with `pandas` and explored using `.info()` and `.describe()`
- Imputed 37 missing `review_rating` values using **per-category median**
- Renamed columns to `small_case` for SQL compatibility
- Engineered new columns: `age_group` and `purchase_frequency_days`
- Dropped `promo_code_used` (redundant with `discount_applied`)
- Connected Python to **MySQL** and loaded the cleaned DataFrame

### Step 2 — SQL Analysis (MySQL)
10 business queries executed to extract insights:

| # | Business Question |
|---|---|
| Q1 | Revenue by Gender |
| Q2 | High-Spending Discount Users |
| Q3 | Top 5 Products by Average Review Rating |
| Q4 | Shipping Type Comparison (Standard vs Express) |
| Q5 | Subscribers vs. Non-Subscribers spend comparison |
| Q6 | Most Discount-Dependent Products |
| Q7 | Customer Segmentation (New / Returning / Loyal) |
| Q8 | Top 3 Products per Category |
| Q9 | Repeat Buyers & Subscription likelihood |
| Q10 | Revenue Contribution by Age Group |

### Step 3 — Power BI Dashboard
Built an interactive dashboard with slicers for Gender, Category, Subscription
Status, and Shipping Type.

### Step 4 — Report & Presentation
- Written report documenting methodology, results, and recommendations
- Presentation built using **Gamma** for stakeholder storytelling
